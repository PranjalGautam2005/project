        <h2>ABOUT RAIN HARVESTING </h2>
        <HR>
        <B>Rainwater Harvesting is a membership category of Irrigation India and is designed for members engaged in
            rainwater harvesting activities including the supply of products and advice and includes the previous
            members of the Rainwater Harvesting Association of India.</B>

        <p>Rainwater is a crucial natural resource that can be collected through rainwater harvesting (RWH), a practice
            used to capture and store rain for various needs such as irrigation, drinking, or groundwater recharge. RWH
            can be divided into two main types: surface rainwater harvesting, where water is collected from the ground
            and stored in ponds, lakes, or tanks, and rooftop rainwater harvesting, where rain is captured from rooftops
            and directed into storage systems. Several methods are employed, including direct-pumped systems, gravity
            systems, percolation pits, underground tanks, and rain gardens, each suited to different conditions and
            purposes. The history of rainwater harvesting spans thousands of years, with evidence from ancient
            civilizations like Mesopotamia, the Roman Empire, and India.
            <br>
            <br> The Romans engineered sophisticated rainwater
            systems, while India’s arid regions, such as Rajasthan, utilized methods like Johads (small dams) and Baolis
            (step wells) to manage water scarcity. Rainwater collection was common throughout history, though it
            diminished with modern plumbing but has seen renewed interest due to sustainability concerns. Today, RWH is
            recognized for its multiple benefits, including water conservation, flood control, groundwater recharge, and
            cost savings, making it a key strategy for addressing water scarcity and promoting environmental
            sustainability in regions facing increasing climate-related water challenges. Its resurgence highlights the
            growing need to sustainably manage natural water resources in response to climate change and growing
            population demands.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Governments worldwide have implemented various rainwater harvesting (RWH) schemes to address water scarcity
            and promote sustainable water use. In India, schemes like Jal Shakti Abhiyan and Atal Bhujal Yojana
            focus on rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge, while MGNREGS includes constructing RWH
            structures in rural areas. Tamil Nadu was the first Indian state to mandate RWH for all buildings, inspiring
            similar policies elsewhere. Australia offers rainwater tank rebate programs, encouraging households to
            install tanks, while the United States has initiatives like Texas’ rainwater harvesting rebates and
            California's drought response programs, providing incentives for RWH installations. China's Sponge Cities
            Initiative promotes rainwater absorption and reuse in urban areas, while Kenya and other countries in
            Africa also encourage rainwater harvesting through national programs. These schemes aim to conserve water,
            reduce dependence on centralized supplies, and recharge groundwater, especially in regions prone to droughts
            and water stress.
